10/10 verry good game. - Linus Torvalds

Values on screen:
Top left - Last Frame physics calculation in milliseconds(for benchmark, not true FPS)
Middle 1st Row - Red - Green - Blue -Glow Strength/"Brightness"
Middle 2nd Row - Friction - Mouse force - Pixel Size - TimeScale(1 = 100% time) - Paint Life(10 by default)
KeyBinds:
Right/Left Click - Pull/Push particles
Middle click (twice) place wall (FOR MACS: Spacebar and click will work instead of middle click)
UP     - Speed up time
DOWN   - Slow down time
RIGHT  - Set time to half-speed
LEFT   - Pause time
SLASH(/) - Screenshot. Saves png image of game to whereever you have the game .jar installed to.
W      - Increase mouse force
S      - Decrease mouse force
D      - Increase friction
A      - Decrease Friction
R      - Reset mouse force to default (1)
F      - Reset friction to default    (0.01)
[	   - Decrease Gravity Force
]      - Increase Gravity Force

Comma  - Decrease Pixel/GlowRadius size
Period - Increase Pixel/GlowRadius size

Q	   - Toggle True Gravity mode(Credits to Ian ramzy for idea)
	- WARNING TRUE GRAVITY GETS EXPONENTIALLY LAGGY WITH MORE PARTICLES. Default particle amount is reccomended
M      - Toggle gravity 
P      - Toggle Paint mode (Works with glow mode!)
C      - Toggle Color grid (Credits to Abdelrahman Hassouneh for idea)
T      - Toggle Rainbow mode
E      - (Hold) Speed up color shift
H      - Switch to Red color (looks like fire!)

	   - Image is scaled to the amount of particles you have set
G      - Enable Glow mode
(ONLY WORK WITH GLOW: )
B      - Toggle diamond mode
J      - Toggle ball mode
L      - Decreases glow strength
O      - Increases glow strength
U      - Toggle pixelized mode
V      - Show/Hide stats on screen
(ONLY WORK WITH GLOW + PAINT MODE)
Z      - Decrease paint life
X      - Increase paint life
